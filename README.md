## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to the Spam Detection NLP Project! This project aims to build a robust spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to accurately classify messages as spam or not spam, helping to filter unwanted messages.

## ‚ú® Features

- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stemming, etc.)
- Implementation of various NLP models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM)
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of results
- Easy-to-use API for spam detection

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-detection-nlp.git
    cd spam-detection-nlp
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üìù Usage

To train the model and detect spam, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess the data:**
    ```sh
    python preprocess.py
    ```

2. **Train the model:**
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```

3. **Make predictions:**
    ```sh
    python predict.py --input "Your message here"
    ```

## üìö Dataset

The dataset used for this project is [SpamAssassin Public Corpus](http://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/). Make sure to download and place it in the `data` directory.

## üß† Model

This project implements several models, including:
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks

You can select the model type by editing the configuration in `config.json`.

## üìà Results

| Model        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Naive Bayes  | 95.6%    | 94.3%     | 96.8%  | 95.5%    |
| SVM          | 96.2%    | 95.1%     | 97.3%  | 96.2%    |
| LSTM         | 97.1%    | 96.4%     | 98.0%  | 97.2%    |
