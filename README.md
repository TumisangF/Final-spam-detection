## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to the Spam Detection NLP Project! This project aims to build a robust spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to accurately classify messages as spam or not spam, helping to filter unwanted messages.

This project is part of NLP project course in the Bachelor's program of Artificial Intelligence at IU International University of Applied Sciences.
